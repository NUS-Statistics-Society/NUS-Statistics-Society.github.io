            <p class="about-intro">The ellipses that are centered around βˆ represent regions of constant
            RSS. In other words, all of the points on a given ellipse share a common
            value of the RSS. As the ellipses expand away from the least squares coefficient estimates, the RSS increases. Equations (6.8) and (6.9) indicate
            that the lasso and ridge regression coefficient estimates are given by the
            first point at which an ellipse contacts the constraint region. Since ridge
            regression has a circular constraint with no sharp points, this intersection
            will not generally occur on an axis, and so the ridge regression coefficient
            estimates will be exclusively non-zero. However, the lasso constraint has
            corners at each of the axes, and so the ellipse will often intersect the constraint region at an axis. When this occurs, one of the coefficients will equal
            zero. In higher dimensions, many of the coefficient estimates may equal zero
            simultaneously. In Figure 6.7, the intersection occurs at β1 = 0, and so the
            resulting model will only include β2.</p>
